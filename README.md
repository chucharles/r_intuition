# Intuitive Statistical Analysis With R

This is a collection of notes for self-teaching statistical analysis in an intuitive way. The goal is to be able to use a variety of high-percentage statistical tools *in the real world.* 

Instead of focusing on complicated mathematics / notations, we will focus on developing intuition in several areas.

* How things "work". In what scenario do we use tool X? Tool Y?
* Tradeoffs. No tool is perfect. Develop intuition on figuring out what tool to use for a particular scenario.
* Real Data.
